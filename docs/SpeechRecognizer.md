# SpeechRecognizer v5.1.0

`SpeechRecognizer` interface provides access to the SPEAR Speech Engine's Recognizer. 
Call [`SpearSdkApi.getInstance().createSpeechRecognizer()`](SpearSdkApi.md) to get an instance of
this class. Please note that
`subscribeRecognitionListener(int, com.thinkamove.spearnative.spear.api.RecognitionListener)` must be
called before dispatching any command to the created `SpeechRecognizer` to receive recognition
notifications.

## public void subscribeRecognitionListener(int uniqueId, RecognitionListener recognitionListener)

Subscribes RecognitionListener to receive recognition callbacks. Please note that this method
must be called before dispatching any command to the created SpeechRecognizer to receive recognition
notifications.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `uniqueId` — unique ID for the subscribing `RecognitionListener`.
    * `recognitionListener` — will receive recognition callbacks from the created `SpeechRecognizer`.

## public void unsubscribeRecognitionListener(int uniqueId)

Unsubscribes previously subscribed RecognitionListener with its uniqueId.

 * **Parameters:** 
    * `uniqueId` — unique ID of the subscribed `RecognitionListener`.

## public void subscribeVadListener(int uniqueId, VadListener vadListener)

Subscribes VadListener to receive SPEAR VAD results. Please note that this method must be called 
before dispatching any command to the created SpeechRecognizer to receive VAD notifications.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `uniqueId` — unique ID for the `VadListener`.
    * `vadListener` — will receive vad callbacks from the created `SpeechRecognizer`.

## public void unsubscribeVadListener(int uniqueId)

## public void setFstGrammar(String fstNamePath, boolean shouldLoadFstExternally) throws UnInitializeException

Sets the complied grammar (FST) to the created `SpeechRecognizer`. Please note that
`setGrammar` (this method or `setCommandListGrammar(CommandList)`) must be called before dispatching
any command to the created `SpeechRecognizer`. Please note if `setGrammar` (this method
or `setCommandListGrammar(CommandList)`) is called for multiple `FSTs` or `CommandList` before hand,
SPEAR ASR will consider the first call to `setGrammar` (this method or
`setCommandListGrammar(CommandList)`) as active grammar when `startListening(boolean)` called until
`changeGrammar` (`changeFstGrammar(String, boolean)` or `changeCommandListGrammar(CommandList)`)
called for other `FST` or `CommandList` to change the active grammar.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `fstNamePath` — Name of the FST or complete path of the FST file depending on the
    shouldLoadFstExternally parameter value.

        * false - Name of the FST (<name>.fst) loaded from the data folder
          (The FST must be included at `resources/com.think-a-move.spear/models/`).
        * true - Complete path of the FST file.
        
 * **Exceptions:**

    grammar successfully.

## public void changeFstGrammar(String fstNamePath, boolean shouldLoadFstExternally) throws UnInitializeException

`setGrammar` (this method or `setFstGrammar(String, boolean)`) is called for multiple `CommandList`
or `FSTs` before hand, SPEAR ASR will consider the first call to `setGrammar` (this method or
`setFstGrammar(String, boolean)`) as active grammar when `startListening(boolean)` called until

 * **Parameters:**
    * `vadResult` — A tuple of a string ('SP' for speech data, 'UN' for unknown or 'NS' for

data (string) and the duration (float).

# CommandList

This class is responsible for providing active commands to SPEAR ASR Engine. Your custom
CommandList class should implement following methods.

## public abstract String[] getCommandList()

Gets a list of active commands.

The list should include all the target commands with interleaved words
and labels.
1. Each command can be separated by pipe "|" or newline character "\n".
   It is recommended to put each command in parentheses to correctly
   parse the grammar.
2. Words/labels inside a command can be separated by a dot(".") or
  unlimited times of space(" "), tabulator("\t"), carriage return("\r").
3. Each word can start with alphabet and be followed by unlimited times
  of alphabet, dash, and apostrophe. (For example, john's).
4. Word can also be a number represented in numerical digit format. Sign
  and decimal points are also supported (For example, -15.46). This
  number will be interpolated as label `$integer` or `$real` based on
  the value of this number.

Please check `GrammarSyntax.md` for more details on accepted grammar
rules by SPEAR ASR Engine.

 * **Returns:**
    * A list of active commands.

## public abstract Map<String, String> mapCommands()

* Key: An input command via voice.
* Value: A command that SpearSdk should return as a result in
`RecognitionListener#onCommitResult(TamTranscriptionPair[])`.

As an example, if your application would like to receive "HELLO" command for the input commands 
"HELLO", "HELL LOW", and "ELMO" then the application should create a map where the value 
"HELLO" should be defined for keys "HELL LOW" and "ELMO".

 * **Returns:**
    * An empty Map or Map of commands to a resulting command.

## public abstract CommandsFileData getCommandsFileData()

Gets the active commands from file.

Use this method if you would like to load commands regex from the file.
This method has precedence over `getCommandList()`. Please check
`GrammarSyntax.md` for more details on accepted grammar rules by SPEAR
ASR Engine.

 * **Returns:** A new `CommandsFileData` object with following parameters.
    * `commandsFileNamePath` — Name of the commands regex file or complete path of the Commands
                                regex file depending on the `shouldLoadFileExternally` parameter value.
    * `shouldLoadFileExternally` —
        * true: if SPEAR ASR Engine should load grammar from any location other than the data folder.
        * false: if SPEAR ASR Engine should load grammar from the data folder
          (The grammar file must be included at
          `resources/com.think-a-move.spear/models/`).

## public abstract Map<String, String[]> getGrammarLabels()

Gets a map of labels and assigned commands to it.

*  Key: A label name must start with an alphabet and can be followed by
   unlimited times of alphabet, numeric digit, dash, underscore, and
   apostrophe.
* Value: A list of commands. Please check `getCommandList()` for
  the format of the commands.

There are three pre-defined labels available:

1. `$digit`: single numeric digit
2. `$integer`: any integer number(sign is optional)
3. `$real`: any real number(sign is optional)

Please check `GrammarSyntax.md` for accepted grammar rules by SPEAR ASR
Engine.

 * **Returns:**
    * A map of labels and assigned commands.
