# SpearWakeUp v5.1.0

`SpearWakeUp` interface provides access to the SPEAR WakeUp Engine.
Call [`SpearSdkApi.getInstance().createSpearWakeUp()`](SpearSdkApi.md) to get an instance of
this class. Please note that
`subscribeSpearWakeUpListener(int, com.thinkamove.spearnative.spear.api.SpearWakeUpListener)` must be
called before dispatching any command to the created `SpearWakeUp` to receive recognition
notifications. 


## public void subscribeSpearWakeUpListener(int uniqueId, SpearWakeUpListener spearWakeUpListener)

Subscribes SpearWakeUpListener to receive SpearWakeUp recognition callbacks. Please note that this
method must be called before dispatching any command to the created SpearWakeUp to receive
SpearWakeUp notifications.

 * **Parameters:**
   * `uniqueId` — unique ID for the `SpearWakeUpListener`.
   * `spearWakeUpListener` — will receive SpearWakeUp callbacks from the created `SpearWakeUp`.

## public void unsubscribeSpearWakeUpListener(int uniqueId)

Unsubscribes previously subscribed SpearWakeUpListener with its uniqueId.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `uniqueId` — unique ID of the subscribed `SpearWakeUpListener`.

## public int initWithFst(String fstNamePath) throws UnInitializeException

Initializes Spear WakeUp Engine with the compiled WakeUp grammar (FST). Please note that,
this method or `initWithWakeWord(String)` must be called before dispatching any command to the
created `SpearWakeUp`.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `fstNamePath` — Abosolute path of the FST file on the device.


 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful.

 * **Exceptions:**
    * `UnInitializeException` — If provided fstNamePath is not valid or null or failed to sets
    the WakeUp word grammar successfully.

## public int initWithWakeWord(String wakeWord) throws UnInitializeException

Initializes Spear WakeUp Engine with specified wakeWord. Please note that, this method or
`initWithFst(String)` must be called before dispatching any command to the created
`SpearWakeUp`.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `wakeWord` — A wakeUp word. Long sentences as wakeUp word is not recommended. We
     recommend to use one to three words as WakeUp word.

 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful.

 * **Exceptions:**
    * `UnInitializeException` — If provided WakeUp word is not valid or null or failed to
     sets the WakeUp word grammar successfully.

## public int startListening(boolean isMicrophoneInput)`

Starts listening for incoming audio from the device's microphone or already collected audio
chunks and SPEAR WakeUp Engine will start decoding them into text. This is an asynchronous call.
`SpearWakeUpListener#onStartWakeUpListening()` will be called when SPEAR WakeUp Engine starts listening
for incoming audio. The decoded text output will be returned in
`SpearWakeUpListener#onCommitResult(SpearWakeUpResult)` callback method.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `isMicrophoneInput` —
        * true: SPEAR starts listening for incoming audio from the device's microphone.
        * false: SPEAR starts listening for already collected audio data. See
        `transcribeAudioData(byte[])` for more details.

 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful or this method is called without calling
    `initWithFst(String)` or `initWithWakeWord(String)` successfully.

## public int stopListening()

Stops listening for incoming audio. This is an asynchronous call.
`SpearWakeUpListener#onStopWakeUpListening()` will be called when SPEAR WakeUp Engine stopped. It is
possible that there may still be audio in the decoder input queue when called this method.
SPEAR WakeUp Engine will decode all enqueued audio first and then stops the engine. If you don't
care about all enqueued audio then call `forceStopListening()`.

 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful or this method is called without calling
    `initWithFst(String)` or `initWithWakeWord(String)` successfully.

## public int forceStopListening()

Force stops listening for incoming audio. SPEAR WakeUp Engine will throw out all enqueued audio
and stop decoding. `SpearWakeUpListener#onStopWakeUpListening()` will be called when SPEAR WakeUp Engine
stopped.

 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful or this method is called without calling
    `initWithFst(String)` or `initWithWakeWord(String)` successfully.

## public int transcribeAudioFile(File file)

Transcribes RAW audio file into text. This is an asynchronous call.
`SpearWakeUpListener#onStartWakeUpListening()` will be called when SPEAR decoder starts transcribing the
file and `SpearWakeUpListener#onStopWakeUpListening()` will be called when SPEAR WakeUp engine done
transcribing the file. The transcribed text output will be returned in
`SpearWakeUpListener#onCommitResult(SpearWakeUpResult)` callback method.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `file` — RAW audio file (*.raw).

 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful or this method is called without calling
    `initWithFst(String)` or `initWithWakeWord(String)` successfully.

## public int transcribeAudioData(byte[] audioData)

Transcribes audio chunks into text. Call `startListening(boolean)` with `false` to start
listening for incoming audio chunks before calling this method.

 * **Parameters:**
    * `audioData` — Audio chunks in byte[].

 * **Returns:**
    *  0: when call is successful.
    * -1: when call is unsuccessful or this method is called without calling
